# 🏧 Simple ATM Simulation

This is a basic simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) created as part of a learning project. It demonstrates simple banking functionalities such as authentication, withdrawing money, depositing funds, and checking balance.

## 🔁 Flow of the Application

1. 🔐 **Login with PIN**  
   User must enter the correct PIN to access ATM functions.

2. 💸 **Withdraw Cash**  
   User can input the amount to withdraw. The system checks for sufficient balance.

3. 🏦 **Deposit Cash**  
   User can deposit a specified amount to increase the balance.

4. 📊 **Check Balance**  
   Displays the current account balance.

## ⚙️ Features

- Simple PIN authentication
- Basic transaction options: Withdraw, Deposit, Balance Inquiry
- Console-based interface (or GUI if applicable)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE or Unity (if Unity-based).
2. Run the main script:  
   `<!-- ISI MANUAL DI SINI -->` (misalnya `main.py`, `Main.cs`, `ATM.unity`, dll.)
3. Follow on-screen instructions to simulate ATM operations.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Multi-account support
- Transaction history
- Error handling (e.g., invalid input)
- GUI with animations or card insert effect
- Integration with databases
